# Teletext

An ambitious [Teletext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletext) clone built with Next.js. Making use of [Bing Search API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-web-api-v7-reference) for news and [API-Football](https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-football) for football. Most of it is still a work in progress, but I intend to keep adding features.
